	<h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>
	<p>The Australian Gold Rush had a great impact on the future of Australia. In this article we will explore
	who, what, when, where, why and how about the Australian Gold Rush.</p>
	<h2 id="grstart">How did the gold rush start?</h2>
	<p> The first discoveries of payable were by Edward Hargraves in February. He found it at Ophir in New South Wales.
	Within a week there were over 400 people digging there for gold, and by June there were over 2000 people digging.
	Between 1851 and 1861, Australia produced one third of the world's gold. By the end of the 19th century, Australia was the largest producer of gold in the world.
	The news of gold spread really fast because many prospectors came to the gold mines.
	Towards the end of August 1851, James Reagan and John Dunlop discovered the richest goldfield the world had ever seen, the Ballarat Goldfields.
	By the end of September 1851 there were about 10,000 people digging for gold near Ballarat.
	</p>
	
	<h2 id="tools">What tools did the miners use?</h2>
	The tools the miners used were:
	<p><li>Pudding</li>
	<li>Cradle</li>
	<li>Panning</li>
	<li>Shaft mining</li>
	<li>Shovel</li>
	<li>Miners pick</li>
	<li>Puddling</li></p>
	
	<p>Puddling was used to separate gold from clay. The clay/gold mixture would be placed in a large contained and then water would be poured in.
	Using a wooden stake, the miner would stir the mixture and the clay would dissolve leaving the gold flecks and sand in the bottom on the container.
	The remaining mixture would then be panned or cradled.</p>

	<p>Cradle was a large wooden tool used to wash through a large amount of soil, gravel and/or sand.
	A miner would shovel a large amount of soil, gravel and/or sand into the hopper, which had a piece of mesh on the bottom that would allow gold and sand to fall through but would catch large rocks and pieces of debris.
	On occasions, gold nuggets could be caught in the hopper as well.
	Water would be tipped onto the soil in the hopper by a miner while another miner rocked the cradle back and forth to help wash the gold and soil through to the riffles.
	Any sand and soil that washed through the hopper would be washed away with the water as it was not heavy enough to sink and be stuck in the riffles as the gold would be.</p>

	<p>Panning was a simple technique used to find alluvial gold, which was small nuggets or flecks
	of gold that were found in creek beds and under the surface of shallow underground streams.
	To use the pan, a miner would place a small amount of soil, gravel and/or sand into a pan as
	well as a significant amount of water.The miner would then swirl out the muddy water leaving
	gold specks at the bottom of the pan that had sunk to the bottom when the
	water was being swirled.</p>

	<p>Shovels were used to put the soil into the cradle as well as used to dig shafts.</p>

	title="Shovel" alt="Panning.jpg" width="300" height="300"/>
	
	<p>Miner’s Pick – was used to break apart solid pieces of rock and soil so it could be placed 
	directly in the cradle or in the case of shaft mining, in a bucket to be brought up from
	the shaft mine and then put through the cradle. The pick was also used to help dig shafts when
	the ground became too hard to dig with the shovel.</p>

	<h2 id="count">What countries did the miners come from?</h2>
	<p>The majority of the miners were from:
	<ul>
	<li>England</li>
	<li>America</li>
	<li>Scotland</li>
	<li>Ireland</li>
	<li>Wales</li>
	<li>China</li>
	<li>Germany</li>
	</ul>
	as they can be seen in from the first Australian census</p>
	
	<h2 id="con">How were the conditions like?</h2>
	<p>When miners first came to the gold fields they lived in calico tents.
	The miners would sleep on a makeshift mattress which was stuffed with leaves.
	Outside their tent they would have a cooking fire, a bucket of water and
	something specific to the miners to help them identify which tent was their own, 
	such as a flag.
	 It was an extremely unhealthy place for children on the goldfields as there were many diseases.
	Food and water were problems for prospectors. Food was triple the price in Melbourne
	and water was scarce in Australia so they drunk alcohol instead.
	Lots of food came from other immigrants.
	Some miners mostly ate mutton or dampers.

	<h2 id="abor">How were the aboriginals affected?</h2>
	<p>The colonizers disrupted their lifestyle, and with the gold rush, it broke their land.
	Some aboriginals were very wealthy in those times.
	Many miners used Aboriginal bush craft, food and knowledge on the gold fields.
	Some Aboriginal people tried to work with the diggers, but
    some aboriginals helped prospectors find gold because they would threaten the aboriginals.
	Aboriginal people knew there was gold there but some didn't know what to do with it, so they 
	helped the prospectors.
    Diggers were very reliant on aboriginal people to act as their
	guides along the road to the goldfields.</p>
	
	<h2 id="after">What happened after the Gold Rush?</h2>
	</p>After the gold rush, many new things happened. Australia had lots more buildings,
	and lots more supermarkets, with decent roads connecting to them. 
	It became a very popular country for its gold rush. Within 10 years, the population of Australia doubled.
	The gold rush also brought in lots of immigrants and the places where gold was found
	were very popular. A good thing is that Australia uses more technology.
	<p>
	
	
	<h2 id="EH">Edward Hargraves</h2>
	<p>Edward Hargraves was the first person to find gold in Australia.
	His full name is Edward Hammond Hargraves. He was born in the UK in 1816
	and died in Sydney in 1891. He lived for 75 years. He was educated at 
	educated at Brighton Grammar School and Lewes.
	He went to sea at 14 and arrived at Sydney in 1832, 16 years old.
	Hargraves worked on a property in Bathurst.
	He had six siblings. When the gold rush started the government gave Hargraves
	£10,000 which translates to $17766.50 now. The place where he found the gold was very
	similar to the one in California.</p>
